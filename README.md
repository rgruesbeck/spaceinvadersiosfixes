An easily modifiable classic Space Invaders game.

## Getting Started
Main code is in frontend/app/index.js

Feel free to modify anything, I've provided comments which should be helpful. Try adding new stuff!

## About The Game

- Use ARROW KEYS or TOUCH to move. It's also possible to Shoot while holding.
- Start with 3 lives.
- You lose one by getting hit by an enemy projectile and gain one by defeating a boss.
- Score gain exponentially increases with each wave!
- Survive as long as possible! 

## Customizations

I've included tips for the best types of assets in each customization section.


Note: If you want, for example, only one SPLAT image instead of 4(for each enemy), just put the same image in all 4 slots.
